# Destructuring-in-Javascript

A. DESTRUCTURING ASSIGNMENT

The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

Destructuring means to break down a complex structure into simpler parts. With the syntax of destructuring, you can extract smaller fragments from objects and arrays. It can be used for assignments and declaration of a variable.

Destructuring saves you time and lines of code. One line accomplishes what 2 or 10 lines of code do. Specifically for React destructuring helps you keep your code DRY.

1. Destructuring Array - by using []

2. Skipping Items

7. Assignment without Object Declaration
